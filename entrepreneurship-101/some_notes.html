<h1>Some Reading Notes</h1>

<h3>Ego is the Enemy - "Talk, Talk, Talk"</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Goal visualization is an important step in accomplishing your objectives</li>
  <li>However, <i>talking about a task</i> and <i>doing that task</i> compete for the same intellectual resources</li>
  <li>This means it is possible to confuse <i>talking about a task</i> with <i>progress against that task</i></li>
  <li>When you talk about a task a lot, you begin to feel like you’ve gotten closer to completing it -- which means, having already experienced some feeling of success and satisfaction, you are also more likely to abandon the task if things get difficult</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Kierkegaard: “Mere gossip anticipates real talk, and to express what is still in thought weakens action by forestalling it.”</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Your likelihood of hiding behind talk and running from accountability increases with the difficulty of the task, particularly when you feel overwhelmed or stressed</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Example: Upton Sinclair wrote a book about what he sought to accomplish as governor of California, which (allegedly) caused him to lose interest in his gubernatorial campaign</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Social media is a common outlet for seeking credit, attention, and comfort through self-satisfying talk -- and is a common outlet for creatives to avoid difficult work</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Example: Emily Gould received a six figure book deal but wasted a year on the internet instead of creating</li>
  </ul>
  <li>In many cases, achieving success requires 100% of your energy, so engaging in talk reduces the available energy to reach a successful outcome</li>
  <li>The resistance we must overcome to achieve success is a constant source of discomfort. It can be demoralizing, draining, and frightening.</li>
  <li>The goal as a creator is to turn the discomfort you feel into an end product</li>
  <li>Early on in any creative journey, silence -- “the ability to deliberately keep yourself out of the conversation and subsist without its validation” -- is your biggest ally. It allows you to face your struggle head-on, and put all your energy into building.</li>
  <li>Your ego will make you feel like you are missing out and showing signs of weakness by remaining silent and ceding the limelight to others, particularly early on in your journey. This is because talk and self-promotion come easy</li>
  <li>Research shows talking aloud while working through difficult problems can significantly decrease your rate of insight and breakthrough (look into this)</li>
</ul>

I think the core insight here is that you must sit with your fears and insecurities and face the difficulty of creative work head-on. Publicly boasting about your accomplishments may make you feel good, but it increases the likelihood you will waste time and resources, and will fail. This goes for social media as much as it does attending parties and accepting awards.

<h3>The Innovator's Solution - "How Can We Beat Our Most Powerful Competitors?"</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Incumbents often believe larger companies with more resources will consistently defeat smaller competitors. This is consistently untrue.</li>
  <li>Others believe established firms are better able to capitalize on incremental innovations than new entrants, but are ineffective in applying breakthrough innovations. This is inconsistently true.</li>
  <li>The reality is as follows:</li>
  <li><u>Sustaining innovations:</u> Targeting demanding, upmarket customers with improved product offerings that can be sold at a premium -- independent of the difficulty of the technological innovation necessary. Incumbents almost always win here because it involves upselling existing customers, who they have the resources to fight to retain.</li>
  <li><u>Disruptive innovations:</u> Targeting new or less demanding customers with simple, convenient, less expensive products that fill an unmet need. Because these target customers are already underserved, new entrants will almost always beat incumbents. Once the product achieves a foothold, the rapid pace of technological progress enables disruptive companies to steal upmarket customer segments from incumbents -- necessary for any new-growth business.</li>
  <li><b>Note A:</b> <i>sustaining innovation</i> is not necessarily incremental, <i>disruptive innovation</i> is not necessarily radical or breakthrough, and neither is intrinsically “better”.</li>
  <li><b>Note B:</b> Incumbents can only combat disruptive technologies by building their own “startup-like” organizations -- establishing new organizations with the full latitude to challenge upstart competitors (e.g. IBM minicomputer business unit)</li>
  <li>Business ideas and technologies are almost never intrinsically sustaining or disruptive, they must be shaped into disruptive strategies</li>
  <li>Every market has a rate of improvement customers are willing to accommodate (e.g. a car company can produce better engines, but our ability to use the performance improvements are constrained by traffic, speed limits, and safety concerns); this rate of improvement differs by the customer subgroup, with some customers never satisfied, and others oversatisfied with a minimal product</li>
  <li>The pace of technological progress almost always outpaces the need of the market to use it. A company whose products are perfectly aligned with mainstream customers’ current needs will continuously strive to improve those products to sell to more demanding groups upmarket. This quickly causes them to overshoot what their mainstream customers can use.</li>
  <li>Traditional enterprise systems of resource allocation are designed to slowly creep upmarket, through sustaining innovations. Because disruptive innovation hits them downmarket, traditional enterprise organizations typically freeze when confronted by it. This is called <i>asymmetric motivation</i>.</li>
</ul>
